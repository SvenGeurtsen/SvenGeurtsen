# Hello, I'm Sven Geurtsen

I’m a Cyber Security graduate passionate about the full spectrum of security from penetration testing to blue team operations and SOC automation. I built an MvP to automate SOC processes with Microsoft Sentinel and Azure, and I enjoy turning attacker insight into stronger detections.

## 🎓 Education

Associate Degree in Cyber Security Hogeschool van Amsterdam
Graduated: 2025

During my studies, I focused on both offensive and defensive security.
I worked on penetration testing labs, vulnerability assessments, and blue team simulations using tools like Wazuh, Arkime, and Metasploit.

My graduation project at Rademaker centered on defensive cybersecurity, where I developed a Minimum Viable Product to automate SOC processes using Microsoft Sentinel, Logic Apps, Azure Functions. I also improved KQL detection rules within Microsoft Sentinel to enhance accuracy, reduce false positives, and optimize the SOC’s overall efficiency.

This balance between offensive knowledge and defensive implementation allows me to approach incidents from both perspectives understanding attacker behavior and designing stronger detections.
